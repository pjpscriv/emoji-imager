# Emoji Gradient

On Facebook Messenger iOS Phone can give their group chats pretty emoji pictures. You can't do this on Android üò§. I wanted to be able to make my chats pretty so I made this.

This is a little website that generates pretty emoji pictures with gradient backgrounds so you can download them, add them to all your chats and be the envy of all your friends.

For example:
```
https://emoji-imager.glitch.me/F3EFF5/5386E4/üêß
```

If the parameters are invalid a random emoji gradient will be generated, e.g.:
```
https://twilight-immense-monitor.glitch.me/not-a-color/also-not-a-color/not-emoji
```
